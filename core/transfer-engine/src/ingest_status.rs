//! Shared per-frame ingest status packing.
//!
//! The receiver's [`ingest`](crate::receiver::ReceiverSession::ingest) path
//! returns only success/failure; the JNI, C ABI, and WASM bindings each need to
//! hand the host a compact per-frame summary (completion, acceptance, mismatch
//! streak, received-symbol count). Packing that into a single 64-bit word avoids
//! a per-frame JSON allocation + cross-boundary string copy at 60 fps.
//!
//! Historically the JNI ([`crate::jni`]) and C ABI ([`crate::cffi`]) layers each
//! kept a byte-for-byte identical private `pack_ingest_status` plus an
//! `INGEST_ERROR` sentinel. This module is the single source of truth so the
//! WASM binding (and any future binding) cannot drift from the wire contract.
//!
//! ## Bit layout of the packed `u64` (all fields unsigned, little-endian bits)
//! - bit  0      : `complete` (1 once the object is fully decoded)
//! - bit  1      : `accepted` (1 if this frame contributed a new symbol)
//! - bits 8..23  : `session_mismatch_streak` (0..=0xFFFF, clamped)
//! - bits 32..63 : `received_symbols` (low 32 bits; real transfers stay well
//!   below 2^32)
//!
//! `received_symbols == u32::MAX` (i.e. bits 32..63 all set, flags clear) is
//! reserved as the [`INGEST_ERROR`] sentinel — a real transfer never reaches it.
